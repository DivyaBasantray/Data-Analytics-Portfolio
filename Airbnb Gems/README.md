# India's Airbnb (EDA)


## 1. Project Objective

- The goal of this project was to analyze the top 500 Airbnb listings across India to understand how factors like room type, Superhost status, city, and ratings influence pricing and customer satisfaction.

- The focus was on using SQL for data cleaning and Python (EDA) for exploring insights — without relying on visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau.

- This project helps answer questions like:

* What types of listings are most common in India?

* Do Superhosts really charge more?

* Which cities have the most and the costliest Airbnb stays?

* What’s the overall guest satisfaction level in India’s Airbnb market?


## 2. Key Insights (Results After EDA)

Pricing:

- Most listings are priced under ₹5,000 per night, showing India’s Airbnb market is mainly budget and mid-range.

- A small group of luxury villas in Goa and metro areas charge between ₹20,000–₹35,000 per night.

Ratings:

- The average rating is 4.7 stars, showing high guest satisfaction.

- Superhosts have slightly higher ratings (~4.8) compared to regular hosts (~4.6).

Room Type:

- “Entire place” dominates (≈ 65% of listings), followed by private rooms and farm stays.

- Travelers prefer privacy and exclusive use stays.

Superhosts:

- Only 16% of hosts are Superhosts, but they earn nearly 2x higher prices and receive better reviews.

Cities:

- Goa (especially Candolim, Anjuna, Calangute) is India’s Airbnb hotspot.

- Gurugram, Lonavala, Jaipur, and Udaipur also rank high in listings and average prices.


## 3. Tech Stack & Tools Used

Tool	Purpose	Why It Was Used:

- MySQL:	Data cleaning, removing duplicates, fixing missing values	For accurate, structured, and query-based data preparation.
- Python (Pandas):	Data manipulation, exploration	Easy to handle structured data for analysis.
- Data visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn): To visualize patterns, correlations, and distributions clearly.
- Jupyter Notebook:	Development & presentation	For clean code execution, graph display, and storytelling.

  
## 4. EDA (Graphs) — Purpose and Business Value

- The EDA helped uncover key patterns in Airbnb’s India market using simple visualizations.
- The price distribution graph showed that most listings are budget-friendly, under ₹5,000 per night, while a few premium stays charge higher prices.
- The ratings chart revealed that guest satisfaction is consistently high, with most listings rated above 4.5 stars.
- From the room type analysis, “Entire place” emerged as the most preferred option, showing travelers value privacy.
- The Superhost comparison confirmed that Superhosts earn higher prices and maintain better ratings than regular hosts.
- Lastly, the city-wise graph highlighted Goa, Delhi, and Lonavala as top locations for Airbnb stays.
- Together, these graphs helped identify what factors drive price, demand, and customer satisfaction in India’s Airbnb market.

### Business Understanding:
The EDA helps Airbnb or property owners understand how to price their listings, identify profitable cities, and what type of properties guests prefer most in India.
